Mechanical Engineering

Mechanical engineering is a vital field that contributes to the development of machines and mechanical systems. This report focuses on two main topics: types of gears and the design of robotic leg joints.

## Types of Gears
The study of gears includes the following types:

1. **Spur Gear**:
   - Used for transmitting rotary motion between parallel shafts.
   - Known for high efficiency and simple design.

2. **Helical Gear**:
   - Functions similarly to spur gears but at an angle.
   - Offers smoother and quieter operation.

3. **Herringbone Gear**:
   - Composed of a pair of helical gears.
   - Utilized for handling heavy loads and reducing vibrations.

4. **Rack and Pinion**:
   - Converts rotary motion into linear motion.
   - Commonly used in steering mechanisms.

5. **Bevel Gear**:
   - Used to transmit motion between intersecting shafts.
   - Available in different forms, such as straight and spiral bevel gears.

6. **Worm Gear**:
   - Consists of a worm and a worm wheel.
   - Used in applications requiring speed reduction and increased torque.

## Design of Robotic Leg Joints
The 3D design of robotic leg joints involves using 6 motors, providing flexible and precise movement. The design process includes:

- **Selecting Appropriate Motors**: To ensure the necessary power and speed.
- **Motion Analysis**: To understand how the robot moves and responds.
- **3D Modeling**: To create a prototype for testing and improvement.

The study of gears and the design of robots are essential components of mechanical engineering. This knowledge contributes to the development of new technologies and the enhancement of existing systems.
